CS 279 HW2 for Brian, Karen, Julian & Zeerak.

## Setup

* Client side code (JS & HTML) should work without any configuration
* To run server code as well, download [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/). Then go into 'Preferences > Web Server' and change the Document Root to be the folder with all the code. Press 'Start Servers' and you should be good to go.

## Folder Info

* /logs is where all the logs from each trial go. Each new log increments the file number. 
* /js has all the javascript
* /css has all the css

## File info

* index.html is the main page of the experiment. It has a bunch of templates to represent the kind of data we want to show, and these templates are filled in at runtime with experiment data
* log.php is called to send up the actual log of the experiment which is then stored
